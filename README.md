Flask Book Catalogue App

This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to manage a list of books. Users can add new books by providing their ISBN, view the list of books, and delete books as needed. The book details, such as title, author, page count, average rating, and thumbnail URL, are fetched from the Google Books API.
